We Are The Rejects (2014)
=========================

Lyrics and Music by Paul Campbell
Performed by The Semicolons at RejectJS

---

robin mehner and his gang of four
came together at their own front door
there's ola and katharina
matti and don't forget lena

they didn't get accepted to
the one and only jsconf.eu
but berlin is a big city
with an even bigger community

we are the rejects
we are the rejects
this wasn't the conference we want
that's why we sing this song

felix made magic in 3d
johannes knows a lot about debugging
romain talked about beekeeping
who doesn't love some p2p?

stefanie located pokémon
mouse braun punked out to go it alone
kamil loves the ampersand
and stephan's plans are mighty grand

we are the rejects
we are the rejects
this wasn't the conference we want
that's why we sing this song

tina's number formatting
and jonathan is machine learning
felix is image processing
and nick is sleepy time hacking

the crazy stuff that is done with js
and this is only by the rejects
it's all really kind of ridiculous
go home, j.s., you're drunk.

we are the rejects
we are the rejects
this wasn't the conference we want
that's why we sing this song

j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!
false isn’t false!
false isn’t false!
not a number!
not a number!
parsed integers!
parsed integers!
j.s. you’re drunk!
j.s. you’re drunk!

we are the rejects
we are the rejects
we are the rejects
we are the rejects
this wasn’t the conference we want
that’s why we sing this song
